# Ty the Tasmanian Tiger - No Man Groves Refreshed
The second Earth opal level, now available to the public after 20 years!

To use this mod, first install ty-mod-manager here: https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ty-1-tools. Then, drag the files into your Mods folder and activate the mod in the mod loader.

Level D2, labeled as "No Man Groves" in the beta files, shares little in common with the earlier level which originally bore that name. Internally, D2 was referred to as "Bridge on the River TY 2." Sadly, the level is quite incomplete and barren, but I prefer to look at it as a blank canvas! The music is a bop, too.

Special thanks to Koushi's rkvMT, Dnawrkshp's ty-1-tools, and Hidden Palace's Project Deluge! Without you, this would not have been possible!
